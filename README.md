# Final Project Ideas

* An online collaborative writing application for musicians.  
It will be something like a cross between garage band and voice notes.  
Instead of focusing on eq tools and digital instruments, the focus will be on accessibility from different locations.  
The user will be able to record a song or a section of a song, send the link to a bandmate who can then listen to what was recorded and record their own track that will play simultaneously with the first track (and any subsequent recordings).  This will aid in the ability of bands to draft songs and write parts for their instrument prior to meeting as a group. It is something I personally would find a lot of value in, which is how I came up with the idea.  
The current working title I'm kicking around is Band Together.

As a user I should be able to see something recognizable as a sound recorder for recording the initial track. The recording will be stored in a user account on the site.  

I should see buttons for adding another track, as well as deleteing tracks already recorded.  

I should be able to play tracks individually or simultaniously.

I should be able to leave comments/annotations linked to specific points in the track playback (a la soundcloud).  

I should have a share button that allows the user to send the link to one or several people who will be given access to the project as collaborators.

* A way to have the events of local bands/other organizations that you follow on facebook automatically exported to an external calendar. If you like a band, you will automatically be notified of any new events they create and be able to access the event information offline.  
This will be for both artists and supporters. I came up with the idea because facebook actively surpresses event shares from bands unless they pay them. I rely on facebook as a central repository of local events as an artist and a user, but I want to lessen the necessity of that connection.  

As a user I should have the ability to opt in/out of being connected to any artist page.  

I should have the ability to easily share events I have created or events I am attending with other users.  

I should recieve reminders the day before and/or the day of for events I am interested in.  

I will be automatically notified of every event made by artist I follow regardless of whether they sent an 'event invite' or not.

My current favorite idea is the first one.  Although it is more of a challenge, I also think it is a more unique and useful idea.  
I have wanted somethink like that for a while and now I feel I have the means to make it myself.  

My first goal in working on this project would be a proof of concept. I want to get multiple recording interfaces on a website with the ability to play back simultaneously. If I can do that, all the other features are auxilary. I will let content dictate form and will worry about a layout after I have the basic componants working. I have done no work in this area before, but my limited preliminary research leads me to believe it is possible.
